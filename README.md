# Volleyball-Website

I would like to create a website that will be used to organize volleyball games.

The core functionality will be to provide the nearest parks between a group of players,
to allow players to rsvp to games, for players to chat, and more.

The problem with other sites, such as meetup, is that events are specific to a location. For
instance, in Meetup, I can create a volleyball event at a specific park at a specific time
and day. What if there aren't enough players that can play at that park on that time/date?
What if there would be enough players at another park that is the same distance from home,
but in the opposite direction and at an hour later? I am hoping this website can make these
connections with the information that players insert into their user profile.
